## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- CSS modules

### What I learned

By attempting this challenge, I got to better understand how _React_ useContext and useReducer hooks work.
Using them in this project has made me realise how so much easier it is to use these hooks rather than just straight props drilling.
It also clarifies how _React_ makes building so much easier in general. Being able to handle the logic and mark-up so seamlessly feels so much more intuitive for me and I look forward to building more with _React_ 😉

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("🎉");
};
``` -->

### Continued development

Going further, I'm going to better my skills with useReducer and useContext. I will do more with them and also learn other, more productive ways to manage state.
Please feel feel free to suggest better ways I could have tackled this project or do a PR to fix or point out any problems you might find 🙂
